## About The Project

[![A_game Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

A_game is a text-based adventure game coded in C++, designed to be reminiscent of text-based games from the 80's.

## Game Objective

You wake up to find yourself alone on an island in the middle of the ocean. You can see a cruise ship on the horizon. Attached to the island are three paths all going in the direction of the ship. No one path seems better than any other; which path will you choose?

Each path contains a random chance for an event during each distance unit (measured in miles). You can collect items to help you along your way; these items can improve your chances during battles, or potentially decrease your distance from the cruise ship.
